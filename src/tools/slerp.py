# most of the extra complexity is to support:
# - many-dimensional vectors
# - v0 or v1 with last dim all zeroes, or v0 ~colinear with v1
#   - falls back to lerp()
#   - conditional logic implemented with parallelism rather than Python loops
# - many-dimensional tensor for t
#   - you can ask for batches of slerp outputs by making t more-dimensional than the vectors
#   -   slerp(
#         v0:   torch.Size([2,3]),
#         v1:   torch.Size([2,3]),
#         t:  torch.Size([4,1,1]),
#       )
#   - this makes it interface-compatible with lerp()
